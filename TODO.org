#+TITLE: Todo

* queries
** get rid of =rdf_find= and =mixed_query=
last two remnants of the old query api, can clean up pl.py immensely after

** new queries
*** songs per artist that don't have a release by that artist

*** listen history:
  date hierarchy reverse sorted, days have time-sorted listens

*** file hierarchy

** query api
*** specify a python function as the view of a query
*** document
*** syntax for typechecking parent and children of a query
- could use this to get rid of the 'root' in tree views

* TUI
** instance ops
*** h popup to show useful keypresses
*** organizing keypresses:
1. actions that direct UI change
2. actions that run RPL queries
3. anything else?

any better categories for abstracting these for using stuff interchangably?

*** should this be its own class
- holding the rpq object?
- holding the window?
- should keypress operations be their own class w/ these references?

** InstanceOps
*** different name from =instance_ops=
*** should be able to load each listed property like from the InstanceView
*** should be able to edit properties from subject or object side
**** new property
1. select from valid property classes
   /create new?/
2. select object/subject from valid as defined by property
   /create new?/
*** should have generic way to create new instance (of anything?)
** investigate running a subterminal esp w/ a subTUI
** window management
*** some scheme for managing windows without needing to be visible tiles in interface
*** windows should be able to load other windows?
*** move stuff around dynamically
*** save and reload window state

* music
** find music files which aren't imported as xcat:AudioFile
*** list by file metadata
*** bulk import albums
*** search for rdf entries that match metadata
*** correct tracklists esp with missing entries
** fix mpd_player ugly wrapping of column contents
